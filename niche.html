          <p> my next door neighbor, as seen above, is stephan jenkins. he's part of a band called third eye blind. we often hear the stereotype of the intensely particular rock star. however, when i first met him, he seemed nice and normal. while he is still undoubtedly nice, he has his rock star quirks. for example, a few weeks into his renovation, he called me over to look at his house's front door. he specifically pointed out the letter slot, and asked me if i though it matched his door hinges. i am no expert on matching letter slots and door hinges, but i do not think of that as something that regular people often do. so, obviously, i was caught off guard. then, as the door opened, it revealed some heavily detailed metalwork of abstract patterns. i can confidently say that they were the most beautiful door hinges i have ever seen. however, he told me, they do not match the letter slot. :(

          the next time you go olallieberry-picking, make sure to follow these simple instructions. firstly, obviously don't pick the red ones. olallieberries are black. that also means that you have to pay close attention not to pick the dark purple ones. you have to look at the berries under the light and find the ones that are the darkest shade black. in terms of size, opt for berries that are not shriveled up or bursting from juice. the shriveled up ones will taste bitter. the overly juicy ones will not have prime olallieberry flavor. thank you for supporting your local farmers.

          gardener tip: if you are on a walk around town and you really like one of your neighbor's plants, snap off a sprig. before planting it, snap off all of the leaves (or at least all of the big ones) to ensure better growth.

            for the past few days i have been listening to 69 love songs, by the magnetic fields. yes, they made a 69-song album of love songs. and yes, it's actually not bad. personally i've been having a good time with a lot of the songs, but my personal favorites right now (im only around 20 songs in) are "i don't want to get over you" and "the luckiest guy on the lower east side." the luckiest guy barely beat out the other song because of how wonderfully sweet the lyrics are. i mean, how can you resist this??? :

            however, if you're still curious about "i don't want to get over you," it has a pretty pretentious albert camus name-drop.

          have you heard of liam james? of course not, that's why i'm here. i am here to take you on a trip through the adorable and the awkward. if you have either heard of or watched psych, liam james is the sweet little kid that plays young shawn spencer. but the real reason i gathered you all here today is to talk about his best movie, the way way back. if you have ever felt lonely while being bullied by a popular blonde girl at your mother's boyfriend's beach house, you will like this movie. basically, there's a young teenager who is staying the summer and is constanly belittled by the mother's terrible boyfriend. he is sad and awkward and can't talk to girls, but one day he meets a young lifeguard who treats him right and invited him to come work at the water park. he sneaks off to the waterpark everyday, and soon enough, he is transformed into a new human being. wonderful. it has all the makings of a classic movie: good music, blue-ass water, and a nice sam rockwell with snazzy sunglasses. that's all i have to say. liam james is pretty cool. definitely watch the way way back if you get a chance.

        a few months ago, near school, i saw a very distinct guy. he reminded me of jason dean (jd) from heathers. he was walking around with his girlfriend (i assume), who had bleached hair and a punk outfit. however, he was the most distinct. it was summer weather outside, and he was wearing a black floor-length trenchcoat, black jeans, and black docs. his shirt was also black, but it also incorporated some color as it had WRATH printed in red capital letter. he was very distinct.

        then, just this morning, i saw a very distinct guy on bart. he was dressed in business casual all black, with a single silver hoop earring and a silver hoop nose ring. he has short, almost military-style hair that he would not stop touching and running his fingers through. very strange. then, when we were leaving bart at embarcadero, he sprinted (yes, sprinted) up three flights of stairs. he was also very distinct.
